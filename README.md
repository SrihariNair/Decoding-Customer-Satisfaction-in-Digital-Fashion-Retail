**Research Synopsis**
Our exploratory research undertakes predictive modeling to estimate user satisfaction, as reflected in user ratings, within the context of online fashion rentals. Initial exploratory data analysis shed light on critical trends, focusing on review text length and sentiment analysis. The research delineates a series of models—Linear Regression and Ridge Regression among them—to determine the extent to which textual attributes and personal features of users can predict satisfaction ratings.

**Methodological Framework**
Our methodology encompassed several stages, starting with rigorous data preprocessing, followed by extensive exploratory analysis, and culminating in the deployment of multiple predictive models. These models were meticulously chosen and applied to understand the determinants that drive user satisfaction ratings.

**Results and Evaluation**
The assessment of the predictive models was based on established statistical metrics, including the R-squared value, Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute Error. The findings revealed that the Enhanced Feature Integration Regression model exhibited superior predictive capabilities compared to its preliminary counterparts.

**Constraints and Prospective Research**
The study recognizes inherent limitations in data representation and the generalizability of the models employed. Future research avenues include more nuanced data collection processes and the incorporation of temporal variables to reflect the dynamic nature of the fashion industry more accurately.
